# peanuts-taxonomy

This repo contains a taxonomy for the TEI/CBML encoding of Peanuts comic strips by Charles M. Schulz. It relates to work being undertaken by my [Winter 2020 Research in Digital Humanities class](https://briancroxall.net/w20dh). For copyright reasons, the encoded strips are within a private repository.
